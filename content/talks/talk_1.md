I gave a talk titled "Don't Block, Just Flow: Embracing Asynchronous with Rust Streams." It focused on using futures::stream::Stream in Rust.

The talk covered the importance of I/O concurrency for all applications, pinning and boxing of dynamic types, the relationship between Send and Sync with streams, and backpressure handling. In general, it explored how futures::stream::Stream is used, the practical utilities it offers for applications, and the issues it helps address.
