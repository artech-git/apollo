Hi there! My name is Prabhat and I am a passionate software engineer with over 3 years of professional experience in the tech industry. I am currently working as a Backend Developer at a [Litheum Labs Pvt. Ltd](https://litheum.com), where I have been able to hone my skills and stay updated with the latest technologies.

I have always been fascinated by the ever-evolving world of technology and its potential to make a positive impact on people's lives. This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Electronics and Telecommunications and since then, I have been on a continuous learning journey.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects ranging from mobile applications to web development. I have a strong background in programming languages such as C++, Python, and ofcourse my personel favorite Rust, and I am always eager to learn new languages and frameworks.

What sets me apart as a software engineer is my ability to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions to complex problems. I am a problem-solver at heart and I thrive in challenging environments.

Apart from my technical skills, I am also a team player and believe in the power of collaboration. I have had the pleasure of working with diverse teams and have learned the importance of effective communication and teamwork.

In my free time, you can find me reading books on technology and enjoying deep techno tracks.

I personally love cycling as a means to battle my sendetary lifestyle.

Iam Fluent in English and German along in my native language Hindi.
